//! What the headless instruments share: a GPU with no window on it, an
//! offscreen target to draw the app's own pass into, and the measurement that
//! reads the horizon back out of the result.
//!
//! `reframe` writes one view; `horizon` writes a run of them and measures
//! each. Both want the same device and the same target, and only the second
//! wants [`skyline`].
